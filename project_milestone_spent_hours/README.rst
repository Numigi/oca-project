This module adds a new field ``Total Hours`` on Milestone form view.

The field ``Total Hours`` is the sum of timesheets of active tasks
associated to the Milestone.

Use Cases / Context
===================

The module ``project_milestone`` allows to define Milestones for a
Project.

Multiple tasks in the project can be linked to a given milestone.

Field ``Total Hours`` is displayed in form and list views of a Project
Milestone and in the tab of Milestones of a Project.

Usage
=====

As a ``Project/User``, I create timesheets and set ``Duration`` for 2
tasks associated to the same Milestone.

|task 1|

|task 2|

I open the Milestone, the field ``Total Hours`` is set with the **sum of
timesheets spent hours** of associated tasks.

|milestone|
